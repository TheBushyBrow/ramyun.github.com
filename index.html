    <p class="intro">A simple and easy quide to yummy ramyun (korean instant ramen)</p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>Grab your small pot or <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/553028029214440850/">ramyun bowl</a> and fill with enough water that will allow the instant noodles to gently float once ready. (This is the most important part and takes time to master. I personally put in about 2 cups of water so that I dont have a watery broth. )</li>
    	<li>Put your seasonings in with your water, place the lid on and wait for it to boil. This makes for a tastier broth and it feels like it boilds faster.</li>
    	<li>Once at boil, break the noodles in half and set into the bowl. Place the lid back on.</li>
    	<li>Wait 1 minute or until the noodle begin to soften up. At this point spin the water a bit with a chopstick and drop one egg into the twirling water. Place the lid back on. (the twriling water makes for a more dispersed egg, rather than one giant yolk)</li>
    	<li>Wait 2 minutes and then lift the lid and sprinkle roasted seaweed and chopped green onions.</li>
    	<li>Now chow down the tastiest, most delicious bowl of ramyun ever!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    
    <p>If you are particularly keen on eatting this like a true Korean, then try grabbing those hot noodles with your chopsticks and set them on the lid of your ramyun bowl. By placing the hot noodles on the lid, you allow the noodles to cool down much faster and you can eat then from there like a little plate.</p>
    <p>Here's a video that shows a very similar process from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCy8X9H3TEs">Maangchi</a>, who makes awesome YouTube videos about various Korean recipes.</p>
